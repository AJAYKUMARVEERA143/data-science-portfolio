About Dataset
Three points to keep in mind about confirmed death figures
The actual death toll from COVID-19 is likely to be higher than the number of confirmed deaths – this is due to limited testing, poorly functioning death registries, challenges in determining the cause of death, and disruptions during the pandemic. The difference between reported confirmed deaths and actual deaths varies between countries.
COVID-19 deaths may be recorded in different ways between countries (e.g., some countries may only count hospital deaths, whilst others also include deaths in homes).
The death figures on a given date do not necessarily show the number of new deaths on that day, but the deaths reported on that day. Since reporting is delayed and the levels of reporting can vary between days, such as on weekends, regardless of any actual variation of deaths, it is more helpful to view the seven-day rolling average of the daily figures as we do in the chart here.
We provide more detail on these points in the section 'Deaths from COVID-19: background'.
